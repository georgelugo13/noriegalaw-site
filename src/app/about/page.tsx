          Welcome to Noriega Law! We are dedicated to providing exceptional legal services to our clients.
          Attorney Chris Noriega&apos;s journey into the law began shortly after he graduated from high school in 1980 and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. While a Marine at Camp Pendleton, Chris ultimately was Honorably Discharged from the Marine Corps as a Non-Commissioned Officer (E-4) in 1986. Shortly after his discharge, Chris acquired ownership of Noriega Bail Bonds, a business he ran both as a bail agent and bounty hunter. As a result, Chris became intimately familiar with the criminal justice system.

While attending law school, Chris was on the Honor Roll and earned the prestigious Witkin Award for Academic Excellence.

Due to his 20-plus years working in the criminal justice system as a bail agent and bounty hunter, Chris has successfully handled just about every type of criminal case imaginable, from low-level misdemeanors to hardcore felony cases with possible life sentences.
